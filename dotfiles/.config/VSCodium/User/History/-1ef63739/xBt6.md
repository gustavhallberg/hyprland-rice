# Initial setup of a new machine

## Step 1
### CachyOS Install 
Select Hyprland and try to get away with as few other packages as possible. 

### Resolution
Venture to the default config and make sure that you are able to see what you are doing, and also remove the autogenerated warning..

### Wifi 
nmtui is probably what I've used in the past, maybe there are other ways but last time, that one achieved what I needed. 
Also, the wifi-config from the install is supposed to follow along into the installed version - if it doesn't work, or if that defined wifi is unavailable, this is a nice fallback to have. 

### Apps 
Run the install apps script, follow it with creating a /projects/ folder in /home

Run the stow script 

### Apps 
(prior to a script's existence / help for creating the script)

* fastfetch
* fish
* foot
* gtk-3.0
* gtk-4.0
* hypr - ofc already there
    * hyprland.conf
    * input.conf
    * keybinds.conf
    * hyprlock.conf
* nwg-look - dunno what it is yet
* qt6ct
* (qt5ct) - haven't been able to create the config yet.

## Stuff I need to add manually
# Ask gemini to update the script with 

- papirus-icon-theme

## Wallpapers
https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers.git
Clone above into ~/projects/community - then move wallpapers do wallpapers folder of choice. Preferably not the whole directory to git because of size.
